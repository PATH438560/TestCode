The favicon.ico file is typically a binary file that represents the icon for the web application. Since I cannot generate binary files directly, I will provide a placeholder comment indicating that this file should contain the favicon data.

Here are the contents for the file:

/qr-code-generator/qr-code-generator/frontend/client/public/favicon.ico

<!-- This file is intentionally left blank. Please replace it with the actual favicon data. -->
